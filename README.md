## Overview 
Text data was extracted from pdfs (Apple vision pro brochure) and from the apple vision pro website.The Data was embedded using the GPT2 Tokenizer. It utilizes GPT-2 knowledge base to answer questions. FAISS is used as 
a vector database for making a query similarity search which finds the top-k documents whose embeddings are most similar to the query which are fed as context to the LLM along with the original query. The prompt is passed
to GPT-2 modified inorder to pass the context and create the Sales agent persona. Gradio is then used to deploy the project.

REPOSITORY CONTENTS : 
- index.py : This file contains the main code which includes a Retriver and a Generator
- dataExt.py : This file contains the script for scraping all text from the pages and other links the page contains. This also extracts text from all pdfs present.

## Features
- GPT-2 Based: Utilizes GPT-2 models for natural language understanding and question answering.
- FAISS: For performing query embedding similarity search . Initially chromadb was tried but faiss was preferred
- Gradio : Gradio is used for deploying the project and building frontend
- Web Scraping Bot: Processes and cleans text data for training.
